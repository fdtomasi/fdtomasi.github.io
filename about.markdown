I am a research scientist at Spotify. I joined the band in March 2019.
I got my PhD in machine learning at Universit√† di Genova, Italy. My research involves developing and applying machine learning algorithms on sequential data, in particular on time-series.
I am interested in graphical models to describe relations between multivariate time series, with the presence of latent (hidden or unmeasurable) variables.
I spent three months (April - July 2018) at the University of Manchester, collaborating with prof. Magnus Rattray and its research group.
Also, I spent the last year of my Master's degree at University of Sheffield, UK, working on differential gene co-expression analysis with the ML@SiTraN group under the supervision of Neil Lawrence. 
In my free time I like to do olympic weightlifting and CrossFit training, as well as playing guitar and occasionally dance (lindy hop).
