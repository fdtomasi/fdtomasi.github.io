Here we are! This year I got the chance to be at the ISMB/ECCB conference, and, *wow*, this conference is HUGE. There are a lot of great speakers, a lot of great tracks! Unfortunately, I would need a [Time-Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Time-Turners) to attend them all.

So, as everyone does, I decided to get a pen and highlight the interesting talks I would be able to attend. Well, I'm a computer scientist, so most of the pure-bio-related talks were out of my league. However, as for the first day I was helped, helped by the fact that yesterday I met the [CAMDA](http://www.camda.info/) organisers, and I decided to attend their track entirely.
