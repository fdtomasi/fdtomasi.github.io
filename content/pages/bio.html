        Welcome!<br/>
		I'm a computational biologist currently located in Genova, Italy, working with the <a href="http://slipguru.disi.unige.it/">machine learning slipguru team</a> at the University of Genoa.
        My research involves applying machine learning algorithms on biological and medical data.
        Currently working with immonoglobulins (antibodies).
        First year of my PhD in computer science at the University of Genoa (Italy).

        <br>I spent the last year of my master at the University of Sheffield, UK, working on differential gene co-expression analysis with the <a href="http://sheffieldml.github.io/">ML@SiTraN group</a>.
