        Welcome!<br/>
		I am a computer science PhD student at Universit√† degli studi di Genova, Italy, working with the <a href="http://slipguru.disi.unige.it/">machine learning team</a>.
    My research involves applying machine learning algorithms on, mainly, biomedical data. <br/>

    I am interested in graphical models to describe relations between biological variables, such as genes or proteins, with the presence of latent (hidden or unmeasurable) variables.

    <br/>
    I am currently visiting the University of Manchester, starting a collaboration with prof. Magnus Rattray and its research group.
    <br/>
    I spent the last year of my Master's degree at University of Sheffield, UK, working on differential gene co-expression analysis with the <a href="http://sheffieldml.github.io/">ML@SiTraN group</a>.
