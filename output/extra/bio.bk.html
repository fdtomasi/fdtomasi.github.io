      Welcome! I am a research scientist at Spotify UK. <br />
      Previously I got my PhD at Universit√† di Genova, Italy, working with the <a href="http://slipguru.disi.unige.it/">machine
        learning team</a> with a thesis on graphical models and latent variables. <br />

      I am interested in graphical models to describe relations between multivariate time series, with the presence of
      latent (hidden or unmeasurable) variables.

      <br />
      I spent three months (April - July 2018) at the University of Manchester, collaborating with prof. Magnus Rattray
      and its research group.
      <br />
      Also, I spent the last year of my Master's degree at University of Sheffield, UK, working on differential gene
      co-expression analysis with the <a href="http://sheffieldml.github.io/">ML@SiTraN group</a> under the supervision
      of Neil Lawrence.
